Problem Statement:
How can the trash bins in metropolitan cities be easily notified and cleaned in an efficient manner?

Proposed Solution:
The level and weight of the trash bins are analysed via a web and that data is generated using sensor. If those bins are filled, then alert the authorities and send the GPS location of those bins to the responsible persons.
